# Abstract
Short-term traffic forecasting is becoming more important in intelligent transportation systems. The k-nearest neighbours (kNN) method is widely used for short-term traffic forecasting.
However, kNN parameters self-adjustment has been a problem due to dynamic traffic characteristics. 
This paper proposes a fully automatic dynamic procedure kNN (DP-kNN) that makes the kNN parameters self-adjustable and robust without predefined models or training. 
We used realworld data with more than one-year traffic records to conduct experiments. 
The results show that DP-kNN can perform better than manually adjusted kNN and other benchmarking methods with regards to accuracy on average. 
This study also discusses the difference between holiday and workday traffic prediction as well as the usage of neighbour distance measurement.

# Usage
Code: to be updated. 

# Results
The results show that DP-kNN gives 9% to 40% improvement than benchmarking methods on average.
